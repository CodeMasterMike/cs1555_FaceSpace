Your java files compile with error:
â€”./FaceSpace.java:224: package java.time does not exist

Please upload the java.time you are using. I am supposed to test your code, but I cannot. If you want to to check it after adding in the package, you can come to me during my office hour or during recitation.


Ok, since your group already showed me your progress, I guess the only problem is the 2~3 functions not working properly. Be sure you make them run before submit your final project.
